Is it time to lead or is it time to die?
Time to raise hell or walk on by?
Is there anybody out there that's payin' attention?
Yeah, yeah

Is it time to speak up or time for silence?
Time for peace or is it time for violence?
Is there anybody out there that's payin' attention?
Yeah, yeah

Tell me what you tryna hide
And what you runnin' from inside
'Cause I got a surprise
We might not make it to the mornin'
So go on and tell me now

Do you have enough love in your heart
To go and get your hands dirty?
It isn't that much, but it's a good start
So go and get your hands dirty
Do you love your neighbor?
Is it in your nature?
Do you love a sunset?
Aren't you fed up yet?
Do you have enough love in your heart
To go and get your hands dirty?

Yeah, yeah
To go and get your hands dirty
